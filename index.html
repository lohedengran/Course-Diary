        <h3>Classwork </h3>
        <h4 id="lesson1">Lesson 1 - February 12th</h4>
            <p>I am very glad that I had watched the videos before the lesson, that made
            it easier following along and recognizing some of the new words I had learnt
            during the videos. Before the lesson I didn’t get Git to function properly and
            I didn’t manage to set up an SSH key, but I got help with doing this in class. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Below I will list some of the topics discussed in the first lesson.
        </p>
        <h5>Git</h5>
            <p>A version control system that is very popular and important to be able to work
            in as a programmer.</p>
        <h5>HTML</h5>
            <p>Short for hyper text markup language, and is the standard markup language for
            creating websites.</p>
        <h5>What are tags and what tags are mandatory?</h5>
            <p>A tag is an element. They  come in pairs, and need a start tag and an end tag,
            and you put the content between the tags. The mandatory tags are head, title,
            body, doc type.</p>
        <h5>Things to remember</h5>
            <p>To be a programmer is to be great at googling. It is not realistic to know how
            to do everything, but getting used to googling and finding the answers is the
            way to go!</p>

    <h4 id="lesson2">Lesson 2 - February 15th</h4>
        <p>We started the lesson with a theory check, where Kate went through what we’ve learnt
            so far. After that we were presented with the classwork assignment, which consisted
            of continuing to work on our course diary but with some added instructions to include
            CSS in our work. Up until now we had only been working with HTML.</p>

    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <h4 id=homework1>Lesson 1</h4>
        <p>As my first homework I rewatched all the videos, which was very helpful and I felt
        that I understood a lot more than when I watched them the first time before the
        first lesson. This was very rewarding!
        <br>
        I took notes as I rewatched the videos, which made it a lot easier when working
        with the home assignment as I could go back to the videos and find the information
        I needed. This is something I will definitely continuing doing and work out a
        system for organizing my notes throughout the course. 
        </p>

<section>
    <h4 id=homework2>Lesson 2</h4>
        <p>Like last week I started my homework by rewatching the videos and taking notes,
            a winning concept I think! I feel that repetition is key, it feels very important
            to be confident (well, as confident as I can be by this stage!) with what we’ve learnt
            in the previous lesson before attending the next.
            <br>
            I continued working with this course diary, trying out a few different styles, fonts,
            sizes and alignments and colors. I can’t say that I love the look, but with my knowledge
            so far I’m happy enough!
