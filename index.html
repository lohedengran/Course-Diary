    <h3>Classwork</h3>
    <h4>Lesson 1 - February 12th</h4>
        <p>I am very glad that I had watched the videos before the lesson, that made
        it easier following along and recognizing some of the new words I had learnt
        during the videos. Before the lesson I didn’t get Git to function properly and
        I didn’t manage to set up an SSH key, but I got help with doing this in class. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Below I will list some of the topics discussed in the first lesson.
        </p>
    <h5>Git</h5>
        <p>A version control system that is very popular and important to be able to work
            in as a programmer.</p>
    <h5>HTML</h5>
        <p>Short for hyper text markup language, and is the standard markup language for
            creating websites.</p>
    <h5>What are tags and what tags are mandatory?</h5>
        <p>A tag is an element. They  come in pairs, and need a start tag and an end tag,
            and you put the content between the tags. The mandatory tags are head, title,
            body, doc type.</p>
    <h5>Things to remember</h5>
        <p>To be a programmer is to be great at googling. It is not realistic to know how
            to do everything, but getting used to googling and finding the answers is the
            way to go!</p>

    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <h4>Lesson 1</h4>
    <p>As my first homework I rewatched all the videos, which was very helpful and I felt
        that I understood a lot more than when I watched them the first time before the
        first lesson. This was very rewarding!
        <br>
        I took notes as I rewatched the videos, which made it a lot easier when working
        with the home assignment as I could go back to the videos and find the information
        I needed. This is something I will definitely continuing doing and work out a
        system for organizing my notes throughout the course.
